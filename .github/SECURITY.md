# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

KotobaDB takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities and our commitment to security.

## üì¢ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in KotobaDB, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Email**: security@kotoba.dev
- **PGP Key**: [Link to PGP key or fingerprint]

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue
5. **Environment**: KotobaDB version, OS, configuration
6. **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the report
3. **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you

We aim to resolve critical security issues within 7 days and will keep you informed throughout the process.

## üîç Security Considerations

### Data Protection

KotobaDB implements several security measures:

- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Input Validation**: Strict input validation and sanitization

### Network Security

- **TLS Support**: End-to-end encryption for network communication
- **Authentication**: Multiple authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access controls
- **Network Segmentation**: Support for network isolation

### Operational Security

- **Secure Defaults**: Security-focused default configurations
- **Hardening Guides**: Production deployment hardening
- **Monitoring**: Security event monitoring and alerting
- **Updates**: Regular security updates and patches

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Memory Safety**: While Rust provides memory safety, certain configurations may expose risks
2. **Configuration**: Improper configuration can lead to security issues
3. **Dependencies**: Third-party dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities
4. **Network Exposure**: Exposed network interfaces require proper protection

### Mitigations

- Use latest stable versions
- Follow security best practices in configuration
- Regularly update dependencies
- Implement network security measures
- Monitor for security advisories
