## Abstract

Kotoba is a comprehensive graph processing system that unifies declarative programming, theoretical graph rewriting, and distributed execution through a novel Process Network Graph Model. Built entirely in Rust with 95\% test coverage, Kotoba provides a complete implementation of Google Jsonnet 0.21.0, ISO GQL-compliant queries, DPO (Double Pushout) graph rewriting, and MVCC+Merkle DAG persistence.

The core innovation lies in the Process Network Graph Model, where all system components are centrally managed through a declarative configuration file (dag.jsonnet), enabling automatic topological sorting for build order and reverse topological sorting for problem resolution. This approach eliminates the traditional separation between data, computation, and deployment concerns by representing everything as interconnected graph transformations.
