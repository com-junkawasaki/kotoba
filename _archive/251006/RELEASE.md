## Version Management

KotobaDB follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]

Examples:
- 1.0.0 (stable release)
- 1.1.0 (minor release with new features)
- 1.1.1 (patch release with bug fixes)
- 2.0.0-alpha.1 (pre-release)
- 1.0.0+20220101 (build metadata)
```

### Version Components

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
- **PRERELEASE**: Pre-release identifiers (alpha, beta, rc)
- **BUILD**: Build metadata (timestamps, commit hashes)

### Version Bumping

Use appropriate version bumps based on changes:

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
# Bug fixes only

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
# New features, backward compatible

# Major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
# Breaking changes
```

## Release Process

### 1. Release Planning

#### Timeline
- **Major releases**: 3-6 months planning
- **Minor releases**: 4-6 weeks planning
- **Patch releases**: 1-2 weeks planning

#### Release Manager
- Designated maintainer coordinates the release
- Creates release issue with checklist
- Coordinates with contributors

### 2. Pre-Release Preparation

#### Branch Management
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
git push origin release/v1.2.0

# Cherry-pick fixes if needed
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

#### Version Updates
```bash
# Update version in Cargo.toml
sed -i 's/version = "1.1.0"/version = "1.2.0"/g' Cargo.toml

# Update version in lib.rs if needed
# Update any hardcoded version strings
```

#### Changelog Generation
```bash
# Generate changelog
git log --oneline --pretty=format:"* %s" v1.1.0..HEAD > changelog.md

# Categorize changes
# Features, Bug Fixes, Breaking Changes, etc.
```
