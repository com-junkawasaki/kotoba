## 🚀 Overview

Kotoba represents a convergence of graph theory, programming languages, and distributed systems, offering a unified framework for complex system development through declarative graph processing.

### 🎯 Core Innovation: Process Network Graph Model

The core innovation lies in the **Process Network Graph Model**, where all system components are centrally managed through a declarative configuration file (`dag.jsonnet`), enabling automatic topological sorting for build order and reverse topological sorting for problem resolution.

### 🏗️ Architecture Principles

#### Mathematical Formalization
```math
G = (V, E, s, t, λ_V, λ_E)
```
Where V represents vertices, E represents edges, and λ provides labeling functions for both.

#### DPO Graph Rewriting
```math
p = (L ← K → R)
```
Complete Double Pushout implementation with formal mathematical foundation.

#### Process Network Execution
```math
∀p_i, p_j ∈ P: (τ(p_i, p_j) = 1) ⟹ π(p_i) < π(p_j)
```
Automatic dependency resolution through topological sorting.

## 🔧 Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70.0 or later
- Cargo package manager

### 🐳 Nix Development Environment (Recommended)

For a reproducible and stable development environment, use Nix with flakes:

```bash
# Install Nix (if not already installed)
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Enable flakes (add to ~/.config/nix/nix.conf)
experimental-features = nix-command flakes

# Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/kotoba.git
cd kotoba

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup-nix.sh

# Enter development environment
nix develop

# Or use direnv for automatic activation
direnv allow  # (if direnv is installed)
```

The Nix environment provides:
- ✅ Exact Rust version (1.82.0)
- ✅ All required dependencies
- ✅ Development tools (docker, kind, kubectl, helm)
- ✅ Reproducible builds
- ✅ Cross-platform support

### Installation

## 💡 Basic Usage Example

### Jsonnet Evaluation

Kotoba includes a complete Jsonnet 0.21.0 implementation supporting arrays, objects, functions, and string interpolation:

```jsonnet
// Local variables and functions
local version = "1.0.0";
local add = function(x, y) x + y;

// Object with computed values
{
  app: {
    name: "Kotoba Demo",
    version: version,
    features: ["jsonnet", "graph", "gql"],
  },

  // Array operations
  numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  doubled: [x * 2 for x in self.numbers],

  // String interpolation
  greeting: "Hello, %(name)s!" % { name: "World" },

  // Function calls
  sum: add(10, 20),

  // Conditional logic
  status: if self.sum > 25 then "high" else "low",
}
```

**Run with Kotoba:**
```bash
# Evaluate Jsonnet file
cargo run --bin kotoba-jsonnet evaluate example.jsonnet

# Convert to JSON
cargo run --bin kotoba-jsonnet to-json example.jsonnet
```

### Graph Processing

Users create `.kotoba` files in Jsonnet format for graph processing:

```jsonnet
{
  // Graph data
  graph: {
    vertices: [
      { id: "alice", labels: ["Person"], properties: { name: "Alice", age: 30 } },
      { id: "bob", labels: ["Person"], properties: { name: "Bob", age: 25 } },
    ],
    edges: [
      { id: "follows_1", src: "alice", dst: "bob", label: "FOLLOWS" },
    ],
  },

  // GQL queries
  queries: [
    {
      name: "find_people",
      gql: "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age",
    },
  ],

  // 実行ロジック
  handlers: [
    {
      name: "main",
      function: "execute_queries",
      metadata: { description: "Execute all defined queries" },
    },
  ],
}
```

**実行方法**
```bash
# .kotobaファイルを実行
kotoba run app.kotoba

# またはサーバーモードで起動
kotoba server --config app.kotoba
```
