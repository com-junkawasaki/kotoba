**Title**: Tamaki: An Autopoietic Computing System - EDVAC and Von Neumann Architecture-Based Digital Computing System: A Modern Approach with Data Flow and Small-World Networks

**Authors**: Jun Kawasaki

**Abstract**: This paper presents a modern digital computing system architecture that builds upon the foundational principles of EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) and Von Neumann architecture, while incorporating contemporary concepts such as data flow execution, heterogeneous computing tiles, and small-world network topologies. The proposed system maintains the sequential execution model of Von Neumann machines as its core, but enhances it with data flow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) runtime for task-level parallelism and memoization.

The architecture features a ring-tree (ÂÜÜÁõ∏) topology with small-world shortcuts, heterogeneous computing tiles (CPU, GPU, CGRA/FPGA, and PIM), and content-addressable caching for redundancy elimination. Through critical path scheduling, NUMA-aware placement, and proximity computing, the system achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining implementation feasibility with current hardware components.

**Validated Results**: Our complete Rust prototype implementation demonstrates 5.7x faster DAG scheduling (74.1Œºs vs 421Œºs), 35x better sequential memory performance (284ns vs 9.92Œºs), 78-85% memoization hit rates, and 288x network efficiency improvement at 65k nodes. Large-scale simulations show 35-45% energy savings while delivering 2.3x-4.7x performance improvements across ETL pipelines, ML training, video analytics, and scientific simulation workloads.
